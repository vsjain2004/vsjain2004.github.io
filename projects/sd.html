        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <p class="lead">
            The Senior Design Project is an intensive, year-long capstone focused on delivering an industry-level solution developed from a project proposed by either university faculty or an industry partner. 
            Our team built a comprehensive course management website for 
            Dr. Simanta Mitra at Iowa State University, tailored to the specific needs of his 
            ComS 3090: Software Development Practices course. 
            The project was evaluated by a faculty panel at the end of the first semester and by an industry panel at the end of the second semester. 
            Further project documentation, reports, and milestones can be found on our 
            <a href="https://sdmay25-14.sd.ece.iastate.edu/" target="_blank">Senior Design Project website</a>.

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The ComS 3090 course centers on semester-long software development projects, 
                    typically involving Android applications built with Java and Spring Boot. 
                    Our Senior Design Project extended this concept by creating a unified, web-based 
                    dashboard that consolidated multiple course management tools into a single platform. 
                    The system integrated resources such as Canvas, CATME, 
                    Google Forms, and GitLab, enabling streamlined access and management 
                    for both Dr. Mitra and his teaching assistants.
                </p>

                <h3>Project Contributions and Design Focus</h3>
                <p>
                    As the Backend Lead, I was responsible for designing the database architecture 
                    and developing backend features that supported frontend functionality and course management workflows. 
                    My work emphasized backend scalability, a robust CSV analysis module for automated data parsing, 
                    and FERPA-compliant security to ensure the protection of sensitive student information. 
                    The platform was deployed on a university-hosted virtual machine managed by Dr. Mitra, 
                    with deployment scripts and database configuration prepared for potential migration to AWS RDS 
                    if required in the future.
                </p>

                <h3>Skills and Knowledge Gained</h3>
                <p>
                    This project provided hands-on experience in backend development, 
                    secure database management, and API integration. 
                    I also gained practical skills in Linux-based deployment, 
                    server configuration, and team-based software engineering. 
                    Serving as Backend Lead strengthened my abilities in technical communication, 
                    documentation, and collaborative design within a large-scale development project.
                </p>
